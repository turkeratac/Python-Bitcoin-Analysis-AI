# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

The K-Means method allows data to be grouped into specific, discrete clusters. Each colored dot represents a data point within a cluster, while the red 'X' marks indicate the centers of these clusters. This clustering is influenced by the choice of the number of clusters, which should be set according to the data structure.

DBSCAN clusters data points based on their density and considers noise and density variations. If your data is very homogeneous or lacks distinct density differences, DBSCAN might create a single large cluster or classify most data points as noise.

As a result, based on the graphs, K-Means can provide better results by partitioning your data into more meaningful and distinct clusters.

# Supervised Learning Algorithms

After training and testing, Linear Regression has proven to be the best-performing algorithm. Since the model's performance is already very high, there is no need for further optimization or performance enhancement.
